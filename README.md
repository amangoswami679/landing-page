# landing-page
* This is a basic webpage design project made under "The Odin Proejct" course. This is made to implement and showcase the Flexbox layout in CSS.
* Project is currently in development and future additions will be made.
* Inspirations for layouts and styles have been taken from : 1) https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png and 2) https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/02.png
* Thank you!
UPDATE:
* A theme has been decided for this project. It would be a database of heroes, containing a list of heroes, their stats, some quick facts and images. 
* Initially, since this is a landing page project, the hero chosen for the particular project is the Punisher (Marvel's vigilante anti-hero). Later on, changes would be made so the landing page contains links to other heroes' pages.
* Thank you!
