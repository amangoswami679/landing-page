# landing-page
* This is a basic webpage design project made under "The Odin Proejct" course. This is made to implement and showcase the Flexbox layout in CSS.
* Inspirations for layouts and styles have been taken from : 1) https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png and 2) https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/02.png
* Most of the text and layouts have been left as seen on https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/81a5d553f4073e593d23a6ab00d50eef8620796d/foundations/html_css/project/imgs/01.png
* This project is to be considered as finished and no further developments are planned as of now.
* Thank you!
